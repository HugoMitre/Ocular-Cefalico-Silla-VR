High-resolution environments typically contain a large number of polygons, which can be visualized in the Game window under Statistics as "Tris". Since objects vary in polygon count, specialized tools are needed to analyze and optimize mesh complexity for better performance.
Mesh Analyzer Tool
Purpose
Evaluates polygon count across objects to identify which meshes require simplification for optimal performance.
Setup and Usage

Import the mesh analyzer code into your scene
Save the scene (Ctrl+S)
Navigate to the top menu bar and select Window
Choose Mesh Analyzer from the dropdown menu
Use the tool to identify objects requiring mesh simplification

Benefits

Performance Analysis: Quickly identify high-polygon objects
Optimization Planning: Prioritize which meshes need attention
Resource Management: Better understand scene complexity

Mesh Simplification System
Requirements
The MeshSimplifier package is required for the "polygon_reducer" program to function properly.
Installation Process

Open Unity's Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
Click the '+' button in the upper left corner
Select "Add package from git URL"
Paste this URL: https://github.com/Whinarn/UnityMeshSimplifier.git
Wait for package installation to complete

Implementation

Script Setup: Attach the "polygon_reducer" code to an empty GameObject
Configuration Menu: An automatic menu will appear for adding target objects
Object Selection: Add objects that require polygon simplification
Button Integration: Attach the "polygon_button" script to initiate the simplification process

Workflow

Select objects for optimization through the configuration menu
Use the polygon button to start the automated simplification process
Monitor progress and results in the Unity console

GPU Instancing Tool
Purpose
Automatically configures GPU Instancing to efficiently render multiple copies of identical objects, significantly improving simulation performance when dealing with numerous duplicate objects.
Key Benefits

Performance Boost: Dramatically reduces draw calls for identical objects
Automatic Setup: Streamlined configuration process
Resource Efficiency: Better GPU utilization for repetitive geometry

Implementation Steps

Create Empty GameObject: Add a new empty object to your scene
Attach Script: Add the GPU Instancing script to the object
Configure Root Folder (Optional): Assign a specific folder for processing
Initialize Process: Click "START GPU INSTANCING PROCESS" button
Review Results: Check Unity console for optimization feedback

Configuration Options

Root Folder Assignment: Target specific directories for processing
Automatic Detection: Let the system identify suitable objects
Performance Monitoring: Real-time feedback through console output

Best Practices
Mesh Optimization

Analysis First: Always use the Mesh Analyzer before simplification
Selective Reduction: Focus on high-polygon objects that impact performance
Quality Balance: Maintain visual quality while reducing complexity
Testing: Validate performance improvements after optimization

GPU Instancing

Object Identification: Target objects with multiple identical instances
Material Compatibility: Ensure materials support GPU Instancing
Performance Testing: Monitor frame rate improvements
Scene Organization: Group similar objects for better instancing efficiency

General Optimization

Incremental Approach: Optimize gradually and test frequently
Performance Profiling: Use Unity's Profiler to measure improvements
Backup Management: Save original meshes before simplification
Documentation: Keep records of optimization settings and results

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Package Installation: Ensure stable internet connection for git URL installation
Script Conflicts: Verify no naming conflicts with existing scripts
Performance Validation: Use Unity's built-in profiling tools to confirm improvements

Optimization Tips

Start with objects having the highest polygon counts
Test performance on target hardware configurations
Consider LOD (Level of Detail) systems for distance-based optimization
Monitor memory usage alongside polygon reduction

These tools provide a comprehensive workflow for analyzing and optimizing Unity scenes, ensuring better performance without compromising visual quality.
